Key2Blog
========

Key2Blog is a simple, XSLT-based static site generator that I developed for the [Key2Gym](http://github.com/equalsdanny/key2gym/) project. 

It lets you to convert loosely-connected but structured tree of pages into a full-featured website with nice framing, breadcrumbs, tables of contents, etc.

I use it to compile the Key2Gym's documentation and official website.
